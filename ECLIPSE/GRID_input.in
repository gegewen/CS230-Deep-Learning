--Note: For alternating the permeability use excel (or better use matlab so you can change it quickly) to autogenerate NZ/2 (e.g. 200) lines of the form 104*value1 104*value2.


--Note: If PERMZ is same as PERMR uncomment the relavant line in the following copy command
COPY

PERMR PERMZ /

--Note: If PERMZ is a multiple of PERMR and PERMR is complicated, you can use the MULT keyword

--This specifies that the Theta boundary is completed (e.g. each gridblock is a full concentric cyclinder) Default is that the boundary is not connected



TOPS
 50*1940 /
--Specifies top of topmost gridblocks, which are listed first in the vector of gridblocks. NOTE: gridblock ordering starts at the top and goes along r, then tht, then down to the next lowest z. Some simulators have a different numbering system for gridblocks (like starting at the bottom). That is just the way Eclipse does it and it's important to know for listing PERM and DZ values etc.
